It can also use raster data (such as satellite weather data), re-rasterizing it to a requested grid that can then be analyzed or colorized, and combined with other non-raster data.  For instance, if you have elevation data in raster form, and income data as individual points, you can easily make a plot of all pixels where the average income is above a certain threshold and elevation is below a certain value, a visualization that would be very difficult to express using a traditional workflow.\n",
